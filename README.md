## 🧟 Bosses

- **Oswaldo**: A formidable Zombie in full Netherite armor. Spawns fireballs and minions, occasionally launching players in a ring of particles.
- **Tim**: A Skeleton archer riding a skeleton horse. Fires exploding arrows for high-stakes encounters.
- **Big Boy**: A Giant that spawns zombie minions and dishes out heavy knockback. Face him at your own risk.
- **Albert**: An infinite slime challenge — Albert never stops multiplying, pushing your survival to the limit.
- **Bartholomew**: A wither skeleton who fights with powerful potion effects. Be prepared for chaos.
- **Piggy**: A wild pig boss that tosses players around like toys. Not your average farm animal.
- **Gort**: A rebellious Vindicator tired of servitude — expect brute force and aggression.
- **Dr. Strange**: A teleporting Enderman who has mastered space travel. Blink, and he's somewhere else.


## 📐 Technical Features

- **Linear Algebra Integration**: Velocity calculations during boss attacks use linear algebra for realistic, dynamic motion.
- **Transformation Matrices for Particles**: Circular particle effects are generated using matrix transformations for visually immersive combat.
